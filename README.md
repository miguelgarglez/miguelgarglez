# Hi, I'm Miguel Garcia 👋

Software Engineer based in Madrid, focused on building products people actually want to use.

- Frontend UI Platform Engineer at Open Digital Services (Santander Group), building shared UI components at scale.
- Product-minded builder: I turn ambiguity into shipped, maintainable features.
- UI craft + frontend depth: React, TypeScript, design systems, accessibility, performance, and motion.
- Proven impact: co-led a QA automation relaunch that reduced regression effort by ~50%.

Currently building:
- Personal site + AI assistant with Astro, React, AI SDK, and Cloudflare Workers (streaming + failover + rate limiting).
