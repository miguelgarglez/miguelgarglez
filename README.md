# Hi, I'm Miguel 👋

Software Engineer focused on building products people actually want to use.

I combine:
- Product mindset (from idea to impact)
- Frontend craft (React/TypeScript, design systems, performance)
- UI taste (clean interactions, motion, and detail)

I like turning ambiguity into shipped features.
